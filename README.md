## Installation

1.  **Clone and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd fed-scenario-cli
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Get a FRED API key (free):**
    - Visit: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
    - Create an account and request an API key.

3.  **Set up your API key** (choose one method):

    -   **A) Environment file (recommended)**
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        # Edit the new .env file and add your API key
        ```

    -   **B) Command-line flag**
        ```bash
        # Use the --api-key flag with the update-data command
        npm run dev -- update-data --api-key your_key_here
        ```

## Usage

### 1. Update Economic Data

First, populate your local database with the latest data from all supported FRED series:

```bash
npm run dev -- update-data
```

This command fetches and processes data for all indicators listed in `src/constants.ts`.

### 2. Basic Analysis

Find historical analogues by defining a weighted basket of indicators. The analysis compares against the most recent data.

**Example:** Find the top 5 historical periods that look most like the last 18 months, with a 60% weight on inflation and 40% on the yield curve.

```bash
npm run dev -- analyze -m 18 -t 5 -i CPIAUCSL:0.6 -i T10Y2Y:0.4
```

### 3. Using Scenario Templates

Use pre-built templates for common research questions.

**List available templates:**
```bash
npm run dev -- list-templates
```

**Use a template:**
```bash
npm run dev -- analyze --template stagflation-hunt
```

### 4. Advanced Historical Analysis

Focus your search on specific timeframes or exclude irrelevant periods.

**Example:** Find analogues, but exclude the last 10 years to find deeper historical parallels.
```bash
npm run dev -- analyze --template balanced-economic --exclude-recent-years 10
```

**Example:** Focus the search specifically on the "Stagflation" and "Volcker" eras.
```bash
npm run dev -- analyze -i UNRATE:1.0 --focus-era stagflation --focus-era volcker
```

### 5. Market Expectations Analysis

Analyze where market expectations diverge from Fed projections using yield curve and dot plot data.

**Example:** Get real-time market vs Fed analysis.
```bash
npm run dev -- market-expectations
```

This shows:
- **Current Yield Curve**: Full 3M-30Y curve with inversion warnings
- **Fed Projections**: Latest FOMC dot plot median and ranges
- **Market Divergence**: Basis point differences with directional bias
- **Trading Signals**: Confidence-scored opportunities with timeframes
- **Risk Warnings**: Recession risk alerts from yield curve inversions

**Example output:**
```
üìä MARKET EXPECTATIONS DASHBOARD

Current Yield Curve
3M: 4.42%   6M: 4.31%   1Y: 4.07%   2Y: 3.86%

‚ö†Ô∏è  YIELD CURVE INVERTED - RECESSION RISK

Market vs Fed Divergence
Market Implied Rate: 3.86%
Fed Projection: 3.40%
Divergence: +46bp

üéØ TRADING SIGNALS
YIELD CURVE PLAY - MODERATE (7.72% confidence)
  Yield curve inverted (-4bp). Consider recession protection trades.
  Timeframe: 6-18 months
```

### 6. Interactive Policy Simulator

Explore what-if scenarios by modeling different Fed policy paths and their projected economic impacts.

**Example:** Launch the policy simulator with balanced economic indicators.
```bash
npm run dev -- simulate
```

**Example:** Use a specific template for simulation baseline.
```bash
npm run dev -- simulate --template inflation-regime
```

The simulator shows:
- Current economic conditions from live data
- Historical best match for context
- Four policy scenarios with 6-month projections:
  - No Change: Continue current policy stance
  - Gradual Easing: 25bp cuts at measured pace
  - Aggressive Easing: 50bp cuts to support growth
  - Gradual Tightening: 25bp hikes to control inflation
- Color-coded projections for unemployment, inflation, and GDP
- Confidence levels and historical precedent warnings
