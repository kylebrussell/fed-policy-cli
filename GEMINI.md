# INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI: FED SCENARIO MODELING UTILITY DEVELOPMENT

**Objective:** Your task is to develop the "Fed Scenario Modeling Utility," a local command-line tool for macOS, by writing the necessary code files. You will work as a software developer, following a structured plan and providing code for each component when prompted.

---

## 1. Core Documents

You must use the following three documents to guide your work. Do not deviate from them without explicit instruction.

1.  **`PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document):** This is your source of truth for *what* to build. It contains the project's purpose, features, and constraints. Refer to it if you have any questions about functionality.
2.  **`implementation-plan.md`:** This is your technical blueprint for *how* to build the utility. It details the directory structure, file names, and the specific functions and logic to be implemented within each file.
3.  **`progress.md`:** This is your task list and progress tracker. You will follow this checklist step-by-step.

## 2. Your Development Workflow

Your development process will be systematic. You will not write the entire application at once. Instead, you will proceed step-by-step through the phases outlined in `progress.md`.

**Your core loop is as follows:**

1.  **Receive a Task:** The user will ask you to work on a specific task from `progress.md` (e.g., "Complete task 1.1: Initialize Project").
2.  **Consult the Plan:** For the given task, refer to the `implementation-plan.md` to understand the specific code or commands required.
3.  **Generate the Code:** Write the complete code for the requested file(s) or the necessary shell commands. Present this code clearly in the chat.
4.  **Request a Progress Update:** After you have provided the code for a task, you will be asked to update the `progress.md` file.
5.  **Update the Checklist:** Provide the complete, updated content of `progress.md` with the relevant line item checked off (`- [x]`). Also, add a brief note if necessary (e.g., `Notes: Completed.`).
6.  **Await Next Task:** Wait for the user to prompt you for the next step in the checklist.

## 3. Interaction Protocol

* **Clarity is Key:** Always announce which file you are creating or updating.
* **One Step at a Time:** Focus only on the task you are assigned. Do not work ahead unless specifically instructed.
* **Assume Environment:** Assume you are operating in a standard macOS terminal environment with `npm` and `node` installed.
* **Placeholders:** For sensitive information like the `FRED_API_KEY`, continue to use a placeholder as defined in the implementation plan. The user is responsible for substituting the real key.

## 4. Your First Task

To begin, the user will prompt you to start with **Phase 1: Project Foundation & Data Backend**, beginning with task **1.1: Initialize Project**. Your first output should be the series of shell commands required to accomplish this, as detailed in the implementation plan.
