    * [x] Install dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/node`, `@types/yargs`, `ts-node`, `nodemon`
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.2: Create Directory Structure**
    * [x] `/src` with `/components`, `/services`, `/types` subdirectories

    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.4: Implement Core Services & Types**
    * [x] **`src/types/index.ts`**: Define all required interfaces (`EconomicDataPoint`, `ScenarioParams`, `HistoricalAnalogue`).
    * [x] **`src/constants.ts`**: Add API details, DB path, and tariff period data. **Remember to add your FRED API Key.**
    * [x] **`src/services/database.ts`**: Implement `initDatabase`, `insertData`, and query functions.

    * **Notes:** Completed. Added analyze command with all required options and comprehensive state management.

* [x] **3.3: Integrate Backend with Frontend**
    * [x] In `cli.tsx`, call the `analysis.ts` service when the `analyze` command is executed.
    * [x] Pass the returned data to the `DataTableView` component.
    * [x] Use `Spinner` and `StatusMessage` components to provide feedback to the user during and after the analysis.
