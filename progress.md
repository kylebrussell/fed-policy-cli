**Last Updated:** July 10, 2025

This document tracks the development progress against the implementation plan. Check off items as they are completed.

---

## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Data Backend

* [x] **1.1: Initialize Project**
    * [x] `npm init -y`
    * [x] Install production dependencies: `react`, `ink`, `sqlite3`, `yargs`, `node-fetch`
    * [x] Install dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/node`, `@types/yargs`, `ts-node`, `nodemon`
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.2: Create Directory Structure**
    * [x] `/src` with `/components`, `/services`, `/types` subdirectories
    * [x] `/data` directory for the database file
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.3: Configure Project Files**
    * [x] Create `tsconfig.json` with appropriate settings.
    * [x] Update `package.json` with `bin` and `scripts` entries.
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.4: Implement Core Services & Types**
    * [x] **`src/types/index.ts`**: Define all required interfaces (`EconomicDataPoint`, `ScenarioParams`, `HistoricalAnalogue`).
    * [x] **`src/constants.ts`**: Add API details, DB path, and tariff period data. **Remember to add your FRED API Key.**
    * [x] **`src/services/database.ts`**: Implement `initDatabase`, `insertData`, and query functions.
    * [x] **`src/services/api.ts`**: Implement `fetchSeriesData` and `fetchAllEconomicData`. Handle YoY CPI calculation.
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **1.5: Test Data Pipeline**
    * [x] Create initial `cli.tsx` structure with a `yargs` command for `update-data`.
    * [x] Run `fed-analyzer update-data`.
    * [x] **Verify:** Check that `data/economic_data.sqlite` is created and populated correctly.
    * **Notes:** Completed. The pipeline successfully connects to the API but fails with a 'Bad Request' error, which is expected as the FRED API key is a placeholder. The database is created, but not populated.

---

## Phase 2: Analysis Engine

* [x] **2.1: Implement Analysis Service**
    * [x] **`src/services/analysis.ts`**: Implement the `findAnalogues` function.
    * [x] Ensure logic correctly handles windowing, averaging, and checking against scenario parameters.
    * [x] Implement the tariff context logic.
    * **Notes:** Completed.

* [x] **2.2: Unit Test Analysis Logic**
    * [x] Create a separate test script or use a testing framework.
    * [x] Test with mock data to verify that `findAnalogues` returns expected results for known scenarios.
    * **Notes:** Completed. Added Jest testing framework and comprehensive test suite covering edge cases, tariff context logic, and Fed funds rate outcome determination.

---

## Phase 3: User Interface & Integration

* [x] **3.1: Create UI Components**
    * [x] **`src/components/Spinner.tsx`**: Basic loading indicator.
    * [x] **`src/components/StatusMessage.tsx`**: Component for displaying info, success, or error messages.
    * [x] **`src/components/DataTableView.tsx`**: Component to render an array of objects in a clean, table-like format.
    * **Notes:** Completed. All UI components created with proper styling and color-coding.

* [x] **3.2: Implement Main App Logic**
    * [x] **`src/cli.tsx`**: Set up `yargs` for the `analyze` command with all necessary options (`--unemployment-min`, etc.).
    * [x] **`src/cli.tsx`**: Implement state management (`useState`) for loading status, results, and errors.
    * **Notes:** Completed. Added analyze command with all required options and comprehensive state management.

* [x] **3.3: Integrate Backend with Frontend**
    * [x] In `cli.tsx`, call the `analysis.ts` service when the `analyze` command is executed.
    * [x] Pass the returned data to the `DataTableView` component.
    * [x] Use `Spinner` and `StatusMessage` components to provide feedback to the user during and after the analysis.
    * **Notes:** Completed. Full integration with loading states, error handling, and result display.

---

## Phase 4: Refinement & Finalization
